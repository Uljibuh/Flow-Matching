Flow Matching: Basic Concepts
The Goal
Given access to samples from a target distribution q (like a dataset of images), we want to build a model that can generate new samples from q.
Mathematical Setup:

Source distribution: p₀ = p (simple, known distribution - usually Gaussian noise)
Target distribution: p₁ = q (complex, data distribution we want to learn)
Goal: Learn how to transform samples X₀ ~ p into samples X₁ ~ q

Key Idea: Probability Paths
Instead of jumping directly from p to q, we create a smooth "path" of probability distributions:
pt for t ∈ [0,1] where:

p₀ = p (source)
p₁ = q (target)
pt smoothly interpolates between them

Think of this like a movie: at time t=0 we have noise, at time t=1 we have data, and pt shows us what the distribution looks like at intermediate times.
The Flow
A flow ψt is a smooth transformation that moves points along this path:

ψt(x): takes a point x and shows where it should be at time t
ψ₀(x) = x (starts where it began)
If X₀ ~ p, then Xt = ψt(X₀) ~ pt

The Velocity Field
Instead of learning the flow ψt directly, we learn a velocity field ut(x):

ut(x) tells us "how fast and in what direction should point x move at time t"
This is like learning the "speed and direction" at each point in space and time
The flow satisfies: dψt(x)/dt = ut(ψt(x))

This is much easier to learn than the full transformation!
